"""
Utility functions for PS1 decimator materials.

This module provides a function to replace an object's material textures with
downsampled versions, giving the characteristic pixelated look of PS1 era
graphics.  The implementation here is intentionally simple: it duplicates each
image texture used by a material, scales it down to a specified size and then
assigns the scaled image back to the material.  It sets the interpolation to
"Closest" so that the texture is not smoothed when rendered.  If an export
directory is provided, the downsampled images are saved as PNG files.

In the context of the enhanced decimator, this module is used by
``operators.py`` during cleanup to downsample textures for the final mesh.

    """
    Replace the image textures of a material with downsampled versions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    material : bpy.types.Material
        The material whose textures will be downsampled.  The material must
        have a node tree (i.e. use nodes).
    tex_size : int
        The approximate size (width and height) to downsample textures to.
        If the original texture is smaller than ``tex_size`` on an axis, it
        will not be upsampled.
    export_path : str, optional
        If provided, downsampled textures will be saved as PNG files in this
        directory.  The directory must exist or be creatable.

    Notes
    -----
    This function iterates over all texture image nodes in the material's
    node tree.  For each image, it creates a copy using
    ``bpy.data.images.new`` with the desired size and copies pixels from the
    original image using Blender's builtâ€‘in ``scale`` function.  It sets
    ``image.interpolation = 'Closest'`` to disable filtering.  If
    ``export_path`` is supplied, the downsampled image is saved as a PNG.
